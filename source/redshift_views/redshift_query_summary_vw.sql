                 label                        - Contains either the name of the file or the query group used to run the query or can be repurposed to define the application name or job name
                 query_id                     - ID of the Amazon Redshift Spectrum query. The query_id column can be used to join other system tables and views
                 database_name                - The name of the database the user was connected to when the query was issued
                 query_text                   - Actual query text for the query
                 start_date_utc               - Date in UTC (in ISO format, such as YYYY-MM-DD) that the query started executing
                 end_date_utc                 - Date in UTC (in ISO format, such as YYYY-MM-DD) that the query finished executing
                 start_time_utc               - Time in UTC that the query started executing
                 end_time_utc                 - Time in UTC that the query finished executing
                 alerts                       - A value that that might indicate performance issues on the query
                 aborted                      - A value that indicates if a query was aborted or canceled, this column contains 1. Otherwise, the column contains 0 (query ran to completion and returned results to the client)
                 used_concurrency_scaling     - A value that indicates whether the query ran on the concurrency scaling cluster, this column contains 1. Otherwise, the column contains 0 (query ran on the main cluster)
                 used_result_caching          - A value that indicates whether the query used result caching this column contains 1. Otherwise, the column contains 0 (result cache was not used)
                 query_execution_time_secs    - Elapsed execution time for a query (in seconds). Execution time doesnâ€™t include time spent waiting in a queue
                 query_blocks_read_mb         - Number of 1 MB blocks read by the query
                 query_temp_blocks_to_disk_mb - The amount of disk space used by a query to write intermediate results, in MB
                 actual_spectrum_scan_size_mb - The amount of data, in MB, scanned by Amazon Redshift Spectrum in Amazon S3
                 rated_spectrum_scan_size_mb  - The amount of data, in MB, scanned by Amazon Redshift Spectrum in Amazon S3 that is set at 10MB minimum per query and used for the Spectrum billing
                 query_cpu_time_secs          - CPU time used by the query, in seconds
                 query_cpu_usage_percent      - The percentage of CPU time used by the query
                 query_queue_time_secs        - The amount of time in seconds that the query was queued
                 nested_loop_join_row_count   - The number of rows in a nested loop join
                 service_class                - ID for the WLM query queue (service class) defined in the WLM configuration
                 queue_name                   - The name of the service class. Not applicable if the query used result caching
                 service_class_category       - Category for the WLM query queue (service class) defined in the WLM configuration
                 query_slot_count             - Number of WLM query slots used by the query
