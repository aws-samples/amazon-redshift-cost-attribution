## Amazon Redshift Cost Attribution

In this repo, there are three views you can reference on how to attribute the cost of a query in [Amazon Redshift](https://aws.amazon.com/redshift/).

* [redshift_spectrum_scan_summary_vw](source/redshift_views/redshift_spectrum_scan_summary_vw.sql) - Contains information about the Amazon Redshift Spectrum query
* [redshift_query_summary_vw](source/redshift_views/redshift_query_summary_vw.sql) - Contains information about a query execution at the query level
* [redshift_query_attribution_vw](source/redshift_views/redshift_query_attribution_vw.sql) - Contains information about the estimated compute cost (in USD) of each query execution

# Pre-requisites
When you download the views, as a pre-requisite before using is to modify the [redshift_query_attribution_vw](source/redshift_views/redshift_query_attribution_vw.sql) script.
Update the values as per the following based on your Amazon Redshift cluster configuration:

* price_per_node_per_hour
* daily_operation_hour
* spectrum_price_per_tb
* concurrency_price_per_second
* cpu_rated_score 
* disk_io_rated_score
* execution_rated_score
* daily_redshift_compute_cost
